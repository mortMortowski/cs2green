                    <h2>Roulette game</h2>
                    <p>This casino was made as a side project however it's fully functional and allows users to play a fair game of roulette. All of the outcomes are fair and you can check that they are not rigged by clicking on a previous outcome in the history section and comparing hash values. <br/> Additionaly before each roll there's a hash value that can be copied and compared with hash value after the roll. If the outcome were to be changed after the timer has started the hash values would be different.</p>

                    <p>Currently users can withdraw crypto and CS2 skins. Keep in mind that withdraws are locked for new users and to be able to withdraw you must first deposit at least $1. This rule was made to prevent users from abusing the free rewards. <br/> Acceptable cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. The gas fees are paid by users so keep that in mind when withdrawing crypto. This will change in the future.</p>
